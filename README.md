An asynchronous Rust Web Framework

## Current State

Hidouki is extremely experimental and not meant for production use. It
currently requires nightly due to async-await

## Code of Conduct
We have a Code of Conduct so as to create a more enjoyable community and
work environment. Please see the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
file for more details.

## Blocking PRs for Ethical Reasons
While we do enjoy community involvement and work, we will not accept
PRs from those currently working at companies deemed to be creating a
negative impact. If you no longer work at said company then we're more
than happy to revisit your PR or accept work. This list of companies
includes but is not limited to:

- Amazon - For abuse and exploitation of workers and reaping large
  profits, while paying nothing in taxes
- Google - For protecting sexual abusers, willingness to work for the
  DoD, Youtube and it's radicalization of those on the far right and
  it's unwillingness to defend those in the LGBTQA+ community
- Twitter - For it's continued defense of Donald Trump and other far
  right actors and it's unwillingness to ban those who use it as a
  vector to radicalize the right and it's role in Fascism and White
  Supremacy making a resurgence
- Facebook - For multiple privacy abuse violations, it's creation of
  Libra to further have control over people's financial information,
  and it's role in radicalization of those on the right and it's
  unwillingness to take a moral stand.
